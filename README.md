# Machine-Leaning-Pressure-Broadening
Upload of the work related to "Machine Learning Pressure Broadening Parameters for Exoplanetary Studies".

Code developed during my PhD for predicting pressure-broadening parameters for molecular transitions, with an initial focus on air-broadening and an extension to multi-perturber prediction.
